We have reset to node 0.8.22, and all tests pass. This means that node 10 breaks
us, which makes us a sad.

- [ ] write a test that sends invalid JSON to the stdio-server and expects to
    receive an error event followed by the client exiting non-zero
- [ ] emit console module

At present, bootstrap.js startup is insane. Fix that:
- [X] emit an error and crash if we receive invalid JSON
- [ ] emit an error and crash if we receive invalid JSON-RPC
- [ ] emit debug logging at interesting moments

Simplify lib/spooky
- [ ] move transports to own modules
- [ ] write error tests, ensure spooky fails gracefully/quickly
